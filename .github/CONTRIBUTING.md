 ## Some simple rules when contributing.
 * Always make pull requests to master, not to branches marked as stable
 * If your changes are only refactoring changes, no test are needed
 * Bug fixes and additions of new features will require test. **(NO EXCEPTIONS)**
    * For bug fixes, we require that you provide tests that shows the current code failing, and then passing with your fixes
 * Comments should be included so that the repo admins can understand what your code does, and why it does it.
